# Overview

This is a simple Unity project that allows for the generation of object positions, storage of frames, and playback.
I wanted to make this because long term, I thought it would be cool to analyze positions in space of sports and active activities to
find distances between certain bodyparts and stats about weight distributions. This was a very early prototype.

# Development Environment

The project uses Unity with Csharp scripts attached to game objects and the keyboard to use project functionality.
 
# Useful Websites

Various tutorials for Julia were helpful, but I focused on:

[TurboSquid.com](hhttps://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/low-poly-male-1824558)

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

- ChatGPT was very useful for the project, but I did have to understand what the code was doing in order to do this.

# Future Work

I learned a lot about using scripting and Unity. There are a lot of things I would improve moving forwards with the project:

- Work on refining the objects in Unity so that the rotation makes more sense and is less sporadic.
- Debug playback issues and figure out why playback has problems when generating large amounts of frames
- Create a bone structure that helps the random rotation become more predictable.
